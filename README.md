The goal of this repo is to serve as a starting point for comparison between existing file sharing services, 
and as a place to outline the desired set of features. 

* Version histories / snapshots with per folder configuration of frequency 
* Per user permissions, where users are not tied to the local machine user but instead exist within the context of the service. 
* Both local and cloud storage devices can be backup targets. In other words, I should be able to backup to S3, and the machine behind the couch.
* Per file / folder / machine selectivity for if that file should be synced or not
* Clear reporting of backup state of files across all systems
* Not cost $$$$, removing the cloud storage and instead just using the local machine is a valid option for this, as long as there is a way to make the local machine (given correct network setup etc) accessible as a backup location while on the road with the laptops. 
* Cross platform support.
* Bonus: Integrations with existing Drive / DropBox / iCloud / whatever you are already paying for. -> Not 100% sold on this, but I would be interested in your thoughts
